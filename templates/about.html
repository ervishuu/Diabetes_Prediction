<h5><b>&nbsp;ABSTRACT : </b></h5>
<p style="font-size:18px;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diabetes is a chronic disease with the potential to cause a worldwide health care crisis. According to
International Diabetes Federation 382 million people are living with diabetes across the whole world. By 2035,
this will be doubled as 592 million. Diabetes mellitus or simply diabetes is a disease caused due to the increase
level of blood glucose. Various traditional methods, based on physical and chemical tests, are available for
diagnosing diabetes. However, early prediction of diabetes is quite challenging task for medical practitioners
due to complex interdependence on various factors as diabetes affects human organs such as kidney, eye, heart,
nerves, foot etc. Data science methods have the potential to benefit other scientific fields by shedding new light
on common questions. One such task is to help make predictions on medical data. Machine learning is an
emerging scientific field in data science dealing with the ways in which machines learn from experience. The
aim of this project is to develop a system which can perform early prediction of diabetes for a patient with a
higher accuracy by combining the results of different machine learning techniques. This project aims to predict
diabetes via three different supervised machine learning methods including: SVM, Logistic regression, ANN.
This project also aims to propose an effective technique for earlier detection of the diabetes disease

<h5><b>&nbsp;Machine Learning : </b></h5>
<p style="font-size:18px;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Machine learning is the scientific field
dealing with the ways in which machines learn from
experience. For many scientists, the term “machine
learning” is identical to the term “artificial
intelligence”, given that the possibility of learning is
the main characteristic of an entity called intelligent
in the broadest sense of the word. The purpose of
machine learning is the construction of computer
systems that can adapt and learn from their experience. A more detailed and formal definition of
machine learning is given by Mitchel: A computer
program is said to learn from experience E with
respect to some class of tasks T and performance
measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as
measured by P, improves with experience E.
With the rise of Machine Learning
approaches we have the ability to find a solution to
this issue, we have developed a system using data
mining which has the ability to predict whether the
patient has diabetes or not. Furthermore, predicting
the disease early leads to treating the patients before
it becomes critical. Data mining has the ability to
extract hidden knowledge from a huge amount of
diabetes-related data. Because of that, it has a
significant role in diabetes research, now more than
ever. The aim of this research is to develop a system
which can predict the diabetic risk level of a patient
with a higher accuracy. This research has focused on
developing a system based on three classification
methods namely, Support Vector Machine, Logistic
regression and Artificial Neural Network algorithms </p>

<h5><b>&nbsp;Supervised Learning : </b></h5>
<p style="font-size:18px;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In supervised learning, the system must
“learn” inductively a function called target function,
which is an expression of a model describing the
data. The objective function is used to predict the
value of a variable, called dependent variable or
output variable, from a set of variables, called
independent variables or input variables or
characteristics or features. The set of possible input
values of the function, i.e. its domain, are called
instances. Each case is described by a set of
characteristics (attributes or features). A subset of all
cases, for which the output variable value is known,
is called training data or examples. In order to infer
the best target function, the learning system, given a
training set, takes into consideration alternative
functions, called hypothesis and denoted by h. In
supervised learning, there are two kinds of learning
tasks: classification and regression. Classification
models try to predict distinct classes, such as e.g.
blood groups, while regression models predict
numerical values. Some of the most common
techniques are Decision Trees (DT), Rule Learning,
and Instance Based Learning (IBL), such as kNearest Neighbours (k-NN), Genetic Algorithms
(GA), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and
Support Vector Machines (SVM).
